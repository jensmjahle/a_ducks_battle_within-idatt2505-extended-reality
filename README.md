# A Duck's Battle Within
A Duck's Battle Within is a 2D top-down action game where 
the player controls a duck fighting for survival against endless waves of enemies. As the game progresses,
the enemies grow stronger and relentlessly pursue the player, creating an ever-increasing challenge. 
The goal is to offer an intense and fast-paced experience where players must rely on their skills and strategy to survive for as long as possible.

This is the final project for the course IDATT2505-Extended Reality at NTNU Trondheim
